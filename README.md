# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Network Intrusion Detection System

Overview

This project aims to detect and prevent network intrusions using machine learning and anomaly detection techniques. The system analyzes network traffic patterns to identify potential threats and alerts administrators.

Features

- *Network Traffic Analysis*: Collects and analyzes network traffic data to identify patterns and anomalies.
- *Machine Learning*: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.
- *Anomaly Detection*: Detects unusual network activity that may indicate a potential threat.
- *Alert System*: Sends alerts to administrators when potential threats are detected.

Requirements

- Python 3.x: The project is built using Python 3.x.
- *Scikit-learn*: Machine learning library for classification and anomaly detection.
- *Pandas*: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- *NumPy*: Library for numerical computations.
